------------Javascript concepts-----------

"Document.write" is used for to write the html content directly in a web page.
we can use javascript anywhere on html by using script tag.
we can add html tag inside javascript.
SLC = // , MLC = /* --- */
3 types of variable 
Var, Let and Const.
The difference between Var and Let is in Let we cannot declare the same thing another time.
We cannot reasign the value in constant.

There are some of the data types;
"hello" ----- string
25 ---- number 
true ---- boolean 
["html","css"] ------ array
{first:"Jane"} ----- object
null ----- Null
var x; ------ undefined

Console.log or console.table or error or warn is used for showing the output in console.For checking error and testing.

Global variable can work inside function and also in outside the function.
Local variable cannot work outside the function. 

To access the HTML element javascript can use the "document.getElementById(id)" method.
InnerHtml property defines the HTML content.



-------------------Javascript has 8 data types.------------------
 
String  = It is a series of character like "John_Die", it can written with single or double quote.
Number  = Number can be written with or without decimal.
BigInt  = It is a new datatype that is used to store big integer values. it cannot have decimals.
Boolean  = Boolean can have two datatype : True / False.
Undefined = A variable without a value has a value Undefined.
Null = Represent the intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol = Represent a unique identifier.

---------------------Object Datatype-------------------

Object = Represent a collection of key value pair.
Array = Represent an ordered list if values.
Date = Represent a specific moment in time.
Function = Represent a reusable set of statement.
RegExp = Represent a regular Expression.

--------------------Events-------------------

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked

-------------------Array-------------------

.tostring() = methods return an whole array with elements in it. / .ValueOf() = same as .tostring().
.at() = method return an indexed element from an array.
join() = methods join array element into string.
.shift() = removes the first element from an array and shift the other element to left.
.unshift() = add the new element to the begining of an array.
.sort() = sort an array alphabetically.
.reverse() = reverse the element in an array.
.splice() = methods add new item to an array. and it can also be used to remove elements. The 1 paramter define where the new element should be added. / 2 paramter = how many elements should be remove.
.slice() = method slice out an piece of an array. ( it is just work like a range )
.indexOf() = method if you want to find the Array element / or index number of it.
.include() = is just like the method of indexOf it can find numeric or string values both. 
.fill() = can be used to fill the all values inside array.
.Object.values() = convert an Object to an array.
.JSON.stringify() = converted to a string with the JavaScript function JSON.stringify().

--------------------------Objects--------------------------

const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
1 point = firstname, lastname, age, eyeColor = properties.
2 point = You can make array in Objects.
3 point = WE can make multiple functions which is also called methods.

-------------------Asynchronous and Synchronous-------------------

An asynchronous operation is a task or process that operates independently of the main program flow, without blocking the execution of the main program.
In a synchronous program, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other. 

The Promise API is a feature introduced in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured and manageable way. A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
